![PromiseKit](http://methylblue.com/junk/PMKBanner.png)

Modern development is highly asynchronous: isn‚Äôt it about time we had tools that made programming asynchronously powerful, easy and delightful?

```swift
UIApplication.sharedApplication().networkActivityIndicatorVisible = true

when(fetchImage(), getLocation()).then { image, location in
    self.imageView.image = image;
    self.label.text = "Buy your cat a house in \(location)"
}.always {
    UIApplication.sharedApplication().networkActivityIndicatorVisible = false
}.error { error in
    UIAlertView(‚Ä¶).show()
}
```

PromiseKit is a thoughtful and complete implementation of promises for iOS and OS X with first-class support for **both** Objective-C *and* Swift.

# Getting Set Up

```ruby
#CocoaPods
pod "PromiseKit", "~> 3.4"

#Carthage
github "mxcl/PromiseKit" ~> 3.4
```

Alternatively, clone PromiseKit and drag and drop its `xcodeproj` into your Xcode project.

## Documentation

* We have a gentle but thorough introduction to PromiseKit at [promisekit.org](http://promisekit.org/introduction/).

# PromiseKit vs. Xcode

PromiseKit contains Swift, so we engage in an unending battle with Xcode:

| Xcode | Swift | PromiseKit |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- |
|   8   |  3.0  |      4     |
|   8   |  2.3  |      3     |
|   7   |  2.2  |      3     |
|   6   |  1.2  |      2     |
|   *   |  N/A  |      1     |

PromiseKit 1 is pure Objective-C and thus works with all Xcodes, it is also your only choice if you need to support iOS 7 or below.

---

We maintain some branches to aid migrating between Swift versions:

| Xcode | Swift | PromiseKit | Branch |
| ----- | ----- | -----------| ---------------- |
|  7.3  |  2.2  | 2 | swift-2.2-minimal-changes |
|  7.2  |  2.2  | 2 | swift-2.2-minimal-changes |
|  7.1  |  2.1  | 2 | swift-2.0-minimal-changes |
|  7.0  |  2.0  | 2 | swift-2.0-minimal-changes |

We do **not** backport fixes (mostly) to these migration-branches.


# Support

PromiseKit is lucky enough to have a large community behind it which is reflected in our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/mxcl/PromiseKit). If you're new to PromiseKit and are stumped or otherwise have a question that doesn't feel like an issue (and isn't answered in our [documentation](http://promisekit.org/introduction)) then our Gitter is a great place to go for help. Of course if you're onto something that you believe is broken or could be improved then opening a new issue is still the way to go üëç.


# Donations

PromiseKit is hundreds of hours of work almost completely by just me: [Max Howell](https://twitter.com/mxcl). I thoroughly enjoyed making PromiseKit, but nevertheless if you have found it useful then your bitcoin will give me a warm fuzzy feeling from my head right down to my toes: 1JDbV5zuym3jFw4kBCc5Z758maUD8e4dKR.
